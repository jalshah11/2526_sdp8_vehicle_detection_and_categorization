# Vehicle Detection & Categorization

A traffic analytics system that processes recorded video footage to detect, track, and count vehicles crossing a configurable virtual line — with direction awareness (in/out), category breakdown (car, bike, bus, truck), and a full-featured web dashboard. Built as part of an 8th semester Software Design Project.

## What it does

You point it at a video file, configure where you want the counting line, and it runs YOLOv8 + ByteTrack over every frame to figure out which vehicles cross the line and which direction they were going. The results land in a JSON file and an annotated video, both of which the web dashboard picks up and visualizes.

On the authentication side, users can register, log in, and build up a personal history of every analysis they've run — along with the ability to export any of those records as a PDF or CSV report.

The counting logic has a hysteresis margin around the line so slow-moving or briefly-occluded vehicles don't get counted twice. Each vehicle is counted exactly once, identified by its ByteTrack ID, and the category is decided by a majority vote across all the frames it appeared in (so a misclassified frame here and there doesn't matter).

## Features

- **Vehicle detection & tracking** — YOLOv8 (nano / small / x-large) with ByteTrack multi-object tracking
- **Virtual line crossing** — configurable horizontal line position; counts each unique vehicle once
- **Directional counting** — separates traffic into IN (top→bottom) and OUT (bottom→top); invertable
- **4 vehicle categories** — car, bike (bicycle + motorcycle combined), bus, truck
- **Annotated output video** — bounding boxes, class labels, track IDs, and a live count overlay burned in
- **Analytics dashboard** — bar charts, pie charts, in/out split breakdown, debug frame stats
- **User accounts** — register, email OTP verification, login with JWT, forgot/reset password
- **Analytics history** — every run is saved to your account automatically when logged in
- **Report export** — download any result as a formatted PDF or CSV
- **User profile** — update username, upload avatar, change password, delete account

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jalshah11/2526_sdp8_vehicle_detection_and_categorization.git
cd 2526_sdp8_vehicle_detection_and_categorization
```

### 2. Python environment

```bash
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

### 3. Environment variables

Create a file at `backend/.env` and fill in the values:

```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/vehicle_analytics
MONGO_DB_NAME=vehicle_analytics

JWT_SECRET_KEY=replace_this_with_a_long_random_string
JWT_ALGORITHM=HS256
JWT_EXPIRE_MINUTES=1440

GMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your_16_char_app_password
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
```

### 4. Frontend dependencies

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

---

## Running the project

You need two terminals — one for the backend, one for the frontend.

**Backend** (from the project root):
```bash
py -m uvicorn backend.app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

**Frontend** (from the `frontend/` directory):
```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`. The frontend checks backend health on load and will show an error screen if the server isn't running.

---

## Usage

1. Register an account and verify your email with the OTP sent to your inbox.
2. Log in — you'll land on the main dashboard.
3. Enter the **absolute path** to a video file on your machine (the backend processes files from the local filesystem).
4. Adjust the settings:
   - **Model** — choose between `yolov8n` (fast), `yolov8s` (balanced), or `yolov8x` (most accurate)
   - **Line Y** — vertical position of the counting line as a fraction of frame height (0.0 = top, 1.0 = bottom)
   - **Confidence** — detection confidence threshold
   - **Invert Directions** — flip what counts as IN vs OUT (useful if the camera is mounted facing the other way)
   - **Frame Stride** — process every Nth frame; set higher to speed things up on long videos (may miss fast-moving vehicles)
   - **Scale** — downscale frames before inference; 0.75 gives a good speed/accuracy trade-off
5. Hit **Process Video**. The backend runs the analysis as a subprocess — this can take a while depending on the video length and model.
6. Once done, the dashboard shows charts and the annotated video. The result is automatically saved to your History.
7. Go to **History** to see all your past runs. You can view full details, delete records, or export to PDF/CSV.

## Notes

- The backend processes video files from the **local filesystem** — you need to provide the absolute path to a file that the backend machine can read. There's no cloud upload.
- OTPs are stored **in memory**, so restarting the backend invalidates any pending OTPs. Users would need to request a new one.
- Avatar images are stored as **base64 data URIs** directly in MongoDB — max 2 MB per image.
- The 1-hour processing timeout is a hard cap. For very long videos, consider using `--frame-stride 2` or `--scale 0.5` to speed things up.
- GPU is used automatically if CUDA is available. CPU inference works but is significantly slower.
